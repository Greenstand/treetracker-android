Thank you for opening a Pull Request!

Before submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:
- [ ] Make sure to open a GitHub issue as a bug/feature request before writing your code! That way we can discuss the change, evaluate designs, and agree on the general idea
- [ ] Ensure the tests are added/updated (if necessary)
- [ ] Ensure the linter passes (`./codeAnalysis` to automatically apply formatting/linting)
- [ ] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)

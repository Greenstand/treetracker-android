How We Handle Data:
        \n
Our primary goals are to use data to create a greener earth and offer an option for economic opportunity in areas of extreme poverty. We believe that the scientific and project related data we collect (that is not private by nature) should be freely available to the public. Unless otherwise authorized we will not disclose sensitive user information, such as contact information. Our primary data collection is focused around scientific research and creating a transparent system to collect field data related to the survival processes of trees as well as any information related to the systematic harvesting of tree related products. This information includes planter geo-tagged, time-stamped photos and other user entered data.
        \n
By using our services, you are agreeing to allow us to use your environmentally related information and make it publicly accessible via websites.

Upon request all user data may be hidden from public view. Phone numbers and/or email addresses may be used by GreenStand to contact planters, but will not be shared with third parties without prior consent.
